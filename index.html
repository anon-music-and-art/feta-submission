            <p><em><b>Sonic Space No. 9; for deliberate sonic sculpture agents (2016)</b></em> is a sonic ecosystem, whose composed interactions create a complex emergent composition that unfolds in consort between the ensemble of sculptural agents, visiting
                human participants, and the physical space of the chamber that it is installed within. </p>
            <p>
                This composition moves away from a central single-computer-based system with large speaker array and multiple microphones towards a system comprised of physically-distinct, single-board computer based, digital sculptural agents. Each agent is housed in
                a wooden structure, runs from a single-board computer, in this case a Raspberry-Pi, and has its own dedicated microphone and speaker. This change in structure and technology, has created exciting new opportunities for the exploration of
                group interactions between individual agents, each with their own understanding and awareness of the physical world.

            <p>For this composition, at least 4 agents are to be used and as many as possible are encouraged, depending on the size of the installation space, resonance, and installation time.</p>

            <p>The sculptures for this work utilize a Raspberry-Pi running a Linux Debian operating system. This allows for the headless operation of the computers in such a way that upon receiving power, the devices boot up, and immediately load and execute the programs for the composition. The signal and music processing was composed in, and is executed with SuperCollider.</p>

            <p>Each agent is itself a complex, cyber-physical system, with many sub-agents/processes running within. This allows each sculptural agent to; understand their sonic space environment; use sonic energy from this sonic space; and transform the sonic space by contributing sonic energy. In essence each of the sculptural agents has been composed with the task to try and create a productive sonic space ecosystem. </p>

            <p>In listening to the sonic space, each agent extracts information to describe what is occurring. Extracted features help describe the timbre, loudness over time, instantaneous amplitude, quality of the audio spectrum, resonant frequencies, number of sonic events occurring over time, and density of events. This information is further processed with machine learning and prediction algorithms to better understand the relationship of events to time and space. Sculptural agents make decisions for how to process sonic energy and alter the sonic space through consideration of this built-up memory created via the machine learning algorithms, as well as in reaction to immediate events occurring in the space. These decisions are used to dictate to the agent how it will process or store the incoming sonic energy, as well as how it will make music with the existing sonic energy.</p>

            <p>In addition, the agents also include control mechanisms that prevent saturation of the environment and encourage diversity of music over time. These include listening/focus algorithms, and a cycle of days/seasons. </p>

            <p>Participants are free to sonically interact or play with the system in any way they feel comfortable. However, to place an emphasis on active listening, comfortable chairs should be placed within the installation space for participants to sit in.</p>
            <p>This piece is appropriate for a number of installation spaces. Ranging from individual rooms, free from excessive noise, to larger open spaces where sound can interact freely and may come from many sources. The agents can either be mounted on microphone stands, or suspended from the ceiling. In order to function, the simply need to have their power chords plugged in.</p>
            <p>The agents may also be set up in one of two ways. 1) clustered all together facing one general direction or, 2) spread throughout the space creating an immersive experience. This decision should be made at the time of install based on the size of the space, number of sculptures to be deployed, ability to place chairs in the space, and consideration of participant traffic flow.</p>
            <p>Although not dangerously loud, this piece will create an amount of noise that is likely not appropriate or welcome in office/work environments. Therefore, care should be taken to separate the installation location away from any offices.</p>

            <p><b>The Sonic Spaces Project</b>, is an artistic and research project that has been ongoing since 2012. This project was originally inspired by the perceived relationships and energy transfer principles within nature and the soundscapes of the woods. The research and compositional output of this has resulted in a number of `sonic ecosystems’, which reflect these principles. The resulting compositions have created engaging interactive opportunities that touch on notions of computer agency, experience-based art, and site-specific couplings.</p>
            <p><b>Sonic Space Ecosystems</b>, are a sub-discipline of interactive music systems, which attempt to represent, adapt, and explore principles of other systems through an open sonic interface. These systems create a complex network of interconnected agents, based on artistically inspired relationships and principles from real-world ecosystems. The characteristics of these compositions create open-form, spatio-temporal, interactive music systems. This model creates flexibility in the presentational and participatory aspects of the systems, as well as creating engaging interactive opportunities that touch on computer agency, experience-based art, and site-specific couplings.</p>
            <p>Sonic Space Ecosystems (clarified here to refer to feedback-based sonic ecosystems) are classified as both cyber-physical systems and interactive music systems, comprised of hierarchically related elements that together perform a system function that is greater than is possible by the individual elements. The primary function of this system is to create a controlled music environment which exhibits emergent qualities of self-organization created through inter-reliant relationships between internal elements in the digital system, and relationships between the digital system itself to the physical sonic space that it is installed within. These elements are made aware of their physical world through microphones that act as input transducers, allowing them to use sonic energy that they then transform according to their individual function (algorithms) as a way of surviving themselves. This transformed sonic energy is then returned to the sonic space through loudspeakers that act as output transducers as a way of potentially affecting the system as a whole. A healthy system is one that exhibits self-regulating states of growth, decay, or steady states and is capable of recovering from unexpected or extreme environmental changes. These systems are open and require external contributions of sonic energy by human-agents/participants or non-living external elements in the environment. This sonic space ecosystem then fulfills Jørgensen’s requirement that “an ecosystem is a dynamic complex of elements, agents, communities, and the nonliving environment, interacting as a functional unit,” while at the same time fulfilling the ideas of interactive music systems. </p>
            <p>As this is intended as an interactive art form it is important for participants to experience these systems. Participation should provide opportunities to reconsider one’s relationship to other systems through experience-based play. Software agents need to be capable of collaborating and engaging with human participants in the system.
